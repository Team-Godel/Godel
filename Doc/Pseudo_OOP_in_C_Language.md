# Pseudo OOP in C languages with structures and pointers

In  C languages we can define a structure regrouping all the simple variables, other structures and even a pointeur on a function that's
going to allow us to call the function by citing the name of the pointer.

  ```
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  ```
